What is Counselling?
Counselling is not the same as giving advice. It is quite different from the general opinion held by people. Going for a counselling session in no way indicates that you are helpless or incapable of solving your problems. By talking about your problems or concerns with a counsellor you will deepen your understanding of your problem and develop the means to deal with them. We are happy to talk over any of your problems and with your agreement may refer you to other sources who might be able to help better such as psychiatrists or doctors.

Do I have to pay for Counselling?
All registered undergraduate and postgraduate students can avail the service free of cost. The expenditure involved if you wish to see the psychiatrist is also borne by the service.

How do I contact the Institute Counselling Service team?
You can contact the team members by seeing us in person, making a telephone call or mail-anything you are comfortable with. The Institute Counselling Service

What do I say?
It doesn't really matter how you present your problem.You can say whatever you like. Sometimes there is silence, sometimes you might find yourself saying things you had not expected to say. The counsellor will help you explore the matter and will keep referring to you to clarify his/her understanding.

What kind of problems can I talk to a counsellor about?
You can come to us for academic problems, emotional issues, career awareness and financial difficulties. These may include stress related problems, exam anxiety, personal problems and career related queries.

What will the counsellor think of me - will they think badly of me for getting into a mess?
Many of our problems arise just because we are human.We all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. No. Counselling is based in the belief that most people naturally strive to make the best use of themselves. When something goes wrong, it is usually because we are pushing ourselves too hard; because we are in a muddle for reasons we don't fully understand or because we are actually are suffering some form of mental distress which is distorting our view of reality. Therefore judging is not helpful or relevant; they need to be supported in finding their own way out of the problem.

How can it be right to be in need of help?
We all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. Needing help is a normal part of this process. You could only label it as failure if you had already decided you must succeed entirely on our own - which is not a burden you have to impose on yourself. If you think you've failed, the counsellor might help you see that this is not all there is to it.

Doesn't asking for counselling mean admitting failure?
Paradoxically it can be seen as a matter of strength to ask for counselling. Many people think that they are being strong in not seeking help whereas in fact those who can admit to their difficulties could be considered the strong ones. Asking for counselling often mean you have taken the first difficult step on the road to resolving the problem.

What if I still feel ashamed of my problems?
Counsellors do accept that it is natural to want to appear successful and that most of us feel some shame when we have problems and so don't want to advertise our difficulties. This is one of the reasons we place a great emphasis on confidentiality.

How confidential is counselling?
Strict confidentiality is ensured in the Institute Counselling Service.

If I have had counselling, does it go on my record?
If a student approaches the Institute Counselling Service, nothing about it will go on his record.

Does it work for everybody?
No, but it seems to offer at least some help to the majority so is worth a try.

Is counselling like psychiatry?
Counselling bears little relation to psychiatry except that both deal with emotional and mental processes. Psychiatrist are trained doctors, who work largely through diagnosis of illness and then by prescribing a treatment - usually involving medication. Counsellors are normally non-medical personnel who work by talking and encouraging you to find your own solutions. Counsellors can however recognize the symptoms of severe mental distress, and may suggest you to consider medical help if seems appropriate.

Can I seek advice regarding a friend or colleague?
If you want to approach us regarding a friend, you are most welcome. We'll try our best to help you in helping your friend.

What exactly is a remedial class?
Remedial Classes are meant to clarify the basic concepts. It is possible that all intricacies and details as taught by the professor are not taught. However the underlying concepts are fully covered in a much simpler manner, on the basis of which further study can be done.

Oh great! So its okay if I don't attend lectures. right?
No, the remedial class are just a help provided when there is difficulty in grasping the concepts in college lectures. They may not cover the entire syllabus(only the difficult parts) and are sometimes not as regular as college lectures.

When can I approach the mentor?
Anytime, when the mentor is free. It depends on mutual understanding between the mentor and student. The mentor can be contacted via phone or other means, and unless he is in the middle of something very important, he is willing to help out.

Only weak students attend remedial classes...
Not at all! It is always possible to miss out on certain concepts while in class or during self study and the academic load may make us all feel pressurized at times. Therefore, asking for help doesn't undermine your intelligence or your capabilities, but only demonstrates your willingness to learn.
